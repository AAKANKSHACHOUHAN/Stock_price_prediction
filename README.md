This notebook aims to predict stocks of the Apple Computers using the LSTM networks. 
Long Short Term Memory Networks are sort of recurrent neural networks often used in machine learning for regression and time series forecasting. LSTM neural networks are distinguished from other neural networks by their ability to memorise input over lengthy periods of time.
LSTMs are meant to recall input for a longer period of time. When your neural network fails to memorise data, you can use the LSTM neural network to solve the problem.
